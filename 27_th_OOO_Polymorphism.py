OOO - Polymorphism


Polymorphism in programming is the ability of objects of different types to be accessed through the same interface, highlighting a principle in 
OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) that allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon. In Python, polymorphism enables
us to define methods in the child class with the same name as defined in their parent class. As a result, the child class inherits the methods from 
the parent class. However, it is possible to modify a method in a child class that it has inherited from the parent class. This is particularly useful 
in cases where the method inherited from the parent class doesnâ€™t quite fit the child class.

In Python, polymorphism is simple to use because Python being dynamically typed does not require explicit declaration of types. This makes 
polymorphism more natural and easier to implement. Here are some examples demonstrating polymorphism in Python.
